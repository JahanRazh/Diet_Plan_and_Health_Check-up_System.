    <h2>Best Diet Plans for Your Overall Health</h2>
    <p>Many diets offer benefits that go beyond weight loss. The best programs for losing weight also
        improve your overall health. The biggest challenge is finding the one that will work for you.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have
        traditionally eaten. It is rich in:
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>vegetables,fruits whole ,grains,fishl,entilsolive, oil Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy
        products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.<br>
        Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits:<br>refined grains,trans fats,
        processed meats,added sugar,other highly processed foods
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Health benefits</h2>
    <p>This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a
        reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show
        that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain cancers<br>
        Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that
        its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight <br>loss
        A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low fat diet,
        the Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low carb
        diet, it produced similar weight loss results<br> One study in more than 500 adults over 12
        months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with double the
        likelihood of weight loss <br>maintenance Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating
        plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress
        by neutralizing free radicals
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2>Other benefits</h2>
    <p>Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of
        mental disorders, including cognitive decline and depression<br>Eating less meat is also associated
        with a more sustainable diet for the planet.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
        The Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, fish, and healthy oils
        while restricting refined and highly processed foods.<br>While it’s not a weight loss diet,
        studies show that it can promote weight loss and overall health.<br>
